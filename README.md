# Computer Graphics and Visualization (CS402.3) â€“ Coursework 2025

## Rock-Paper-Scissors Gesture Recognition Game

This is a collaborative group project submitted as part of the coursework for **CS402.3 â€“ Computer Graphics and Visualization**, conducted by **Dr. Rasika Ranaweera** at NSBM Green University. This repository contains the prototype and development files for a computer vision-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game with real-time gesture recognition.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

Develop a **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game using Python that allows users to play using **real-time hand gestures**. The system captures the user's hand via webcam, processes the image, and classifies it into a gesture using basic image processing techniques. The computer will simultaneously respond with its own gesture, and the winner will be determined using traditional game rules.
