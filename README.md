## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

Develop a **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game using Python that allows users to play using **real-time hand gestures**. The system captures the user's hand via webcam, processes the image, and classifies it into a gesture using basic image processing techniques. The computer will simultaneously respond with its own gesture, and the winner will be determined using traditional game rules.
